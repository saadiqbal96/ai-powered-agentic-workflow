AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management

This repository contains all files, resources, and instructions required to complete the project. Additional context and guidance for the assignment are available through the Udacity Classroom.

Getting Started

To begin working on the project locally, I set up a dedicated Python environment using Conda:

Create a Conda environment

conda create -n agentic_workflows python=3.13


Activate the environment

conda activate agentic_workflows


Install project dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


The project is completed in two separate phases. Starter code for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 is provided in the starter directory within this repository.

Dependencies

A requirements.txt file is included for local development. Alternatively, the Udacity-provided workspace already includes all necessary libraries and does not require additional setup.

Project Instructions

Detailed instructions for each phase of the project can be found in the corresponding README file located within each phase’s directory.
