This directory contains the starter code provided for the project. 

The project is structured into two distinct phases—Phase 1 and Phase 2—and the starter code is organized accordingly.

As the project progresses, files developed during Phase 1 are intended to be reused in Phase 2. 

Where required, I moved the relevant files from the Phase 1 directory into the Phase 2 directory to support the implementation of the complete agentic workflow.
